# MATRIX_RANDOMNUMTEST


This is used to test the performance of MATRIX random number design from a dimension of indicators: Chi-square indicator, KSTest indicator, autocorrelation, multi-dimensional Chi-square indicator, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, monobit test, in-block frequency test. 

Various random number algorithms are used, including: Mersenne Twister, well2024, xorshift, etc.
